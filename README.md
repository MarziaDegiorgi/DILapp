## Overview
“Inter Nosco” is a mobile learning game, designed for children, that exploits a different interaction between the child and the device. Indeed the main scope of this application is to use physical objects as means to enable the communication replacing the traditional direct interaction with the mobile interface. In this way, we try to create a diverse learning process associated with colors, shapes, names, letters, numbers, words and logic that is not fully digital and includes real-world objects.

## Requirements
* Mobile phone with enbadded NFC
* Android v. 5.1 or higher

Moreover there is a particular section of the “Inter Nosco” application meant for parents where they can keep track of the children progress regarding the overall results reached by the child over time or specific for each level. Then, it is possible to share directly these statistics of progress or enable automatic reports that are sent by email.
